	I went to Sanpya market for the week. One thing I was disappointed with the market is the lack of car parking. The responsible just took the coumpound entry fee but did care about the parking. It seems they thought the parking was not their concern.

After I took the shower, I went to CBC. I had to give the expense voucher to the audit team because I forgot to give the secretary when I had given other documents last Sunday. After I gave the expense book, I went to TBC where the Khuado pawi was celebrated.

I went back to CBC and working some issue of the audit team reported.
